 Creating a CLI Gem was the first truly independent coding I've done, and I was thus naturally intimidated at first.  Several hours of videos (Thanks, Avi) and reading later, I realized that like most tasks, this could be done as long as I focused on one step at a time.
 
 Choosing the actual function of my Gem was one of the hardest aspects of this project.  While I have a background in Music Production and am thus generally seasoned in creative practices, I hadn't entered the creative space required for this project before; While I have, like many other people, discussed with friends at length how great it would be "if there was an app" that acheived some given goal, I have always lacked the accumen to understand how to acheive any of these goals.  I decided to let the project breathe for a day until I encountered a problem/practice that might be solved/made more efficient via code--within a few hours, I had my idea.
 
 My CLI Gem scrapes TimeOut's listings of free events in NYC and presents the information to the user via the command line.  Upon running the program, users are given 3 free events and the option to learn more about each of them.  After choosing an event to learn more about, users are given a more detailed description, location, url to learn more, and a date until which the event is available for free.
 
 I built a simple CLI Gem that my girlfriend and I (and others, I hope!) can use to see if there are any free events around the city that we'd be interested in.
